# Project about the Management of a Barber Shop
- Created by Er Rmili Ali, Modified by prof. Giachetto Daniele

## Description of the original project
This Project consists of 5 Files including the Main file:

-The Main File contains section that takes input for series of information such as the name of the barber and barbershop, the max capacity of the barbershop, and so on. Later we have a section that includes the Management of the barbershop and creation of clients.

-The Barber File is home of the Barber class which handles a good amount of the program's functionality. It has attributes and methods used to create and run the Barber, and many void function that define barber's action such as cutting hair, resting and others..

-The BarberShop contains the BarberShop class, which is also important to the program. This class has the functions to manage the customer flow adding or removing them.

-Lastly, we have the Client File and the Person File that play smaller roles. Inside of them we have The Person class that is used to be inherited by both the Client and Barber class, and the Client class that has only the attributes and methods that are used to create and run the Client.

## Changes done

I've updated the project to 
1) Write in a csv format the data about queue size using an "Inspector" class;
2) Create a GUI using canvas and objects to show graphically what the queue is at a given time.
